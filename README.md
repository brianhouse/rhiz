Markov chain patterns with native python structures

Timing is < 2ms accurate, which is below the 6ms minimal threshold of human perception

## Next



Are arbitrary functions executed?
(Would that allow over the barline stuff?)

    Binary operators you can repurpose

    +, -, *, /, @, |, &, ^, <<, >>, %

    Comparisons (<, >, ==, !=) also overloadable but must return booleans to be sane.


oh snap!

S(C, C) * 4 * ease_in ==> ease in over 4 cycles
S(C, C) * ease_in * 4 ==> each cycle ease_in, repeat 4 times

so this does make sense to have separate. 



BD>3 and BD<3 to show pushing it in some direction by some amount
