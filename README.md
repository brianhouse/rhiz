## Next


signals

/

an optional third term for probabilities [K, K, (S, K, .1), K]
if there are multiple probabilities, a single third term defines just the first, and the others split? or enforce the right number of probs?

sets with dict and notes do the dict first for paramter locks

config mappings


//


nooooooo can't have a dict inside a set. but that's exactly when I'd need it
