## Concept

Markov chain patterns with native python structures

## Next



Are arbitrary functions executed?
(Would that allow over the barline stuff?)

    Binary operators you can repurpose

    +, -, *, /, @, |, &, ^, <<, >>, %

    Comparisons (<, >, ==, !=) also overloadable but must return booleans to be sane.
