# Rhiz

A sequencer for Python

## Concept

Markov chain patterns with native python structures

## note offs

- if it's monophonic, you don't need noteoffs.
- if it isn't, then they have to be explicit anyway.
- the only situation you'd want it is if you want a polyphonic instrument to behave monophonically
- the problem is that it really should be customizable by channel



## Next


let Note play the note; midi will then have to keep track for note-offs (fine to have it in there, can clean it up as well). have a config for whether note-offs are sent or not. ~C4 allows explicit note-offs if they're not automatically done.


play() and wait() in __init__

channel(3).play(pat)  # something like this? 
play(3, pat) # or this?

just need tween

arbitrary = T(0, 127, 4)
pat = C4, C4, Î£(C4, {20: arbitrary})

//

oh damn! set syntax would work for chords.

pat = C4, C4, {C4, {20: arbitrary}}

fuckin ace.

//


phase IS micro

an optional third term for probabilities [K, K, (S, K, .1), K]
if there are multiple probabilities, a single third term defines just the first, and the others split? or enforce the right number of probs?



sets with dict and notes do the dict first for paramter locks
