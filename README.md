# Rhiz

A sequencer for Python

## Concept

Markov chain patterns with native python structures

Timing is < 2ms accurate, which is below the 6ms minimal threshold of human perception

Are arbitrary functions executed?
(Would that allow over the barline stuff?)

the signal/timing/phase functions should be executed in a pattern! so it's all breakpoints, in a sense. does that work? how does the signal anticipate its length? but that would be so much better than sculpting a separate breakpoint and applying it.


## Next

perhaps phase does make sense
